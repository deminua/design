        <h1>About us</h1>
        
			<p>Design and creativity are active and engaging experiences that stimulate collaboration toward a common goal. We invite you to think about design and creativity as a process - together let's talk about how we can bring your creative endeavour to life.</p>

			<p>LLC "SK KROST" is a collaborative, interdisciplinary bureau that works on intersection of architecture, communication and industrial design. The bureau works with any scale â€” we design and develop masterplans and public buildings as well as country houses and private interiors. We solve complex multidisciplinary tasks which include wide range of questions linking different aspects of the design process.</p>

			<strong>RESPONSIBLE SPACE CONCEPTS</strong>
			<p>Highly -functional space is always solid.</p>
			<p>Having created it we just add the essentials.
			Creating an interior that is simple but exciting to be in is most challenging. We always strive for this.
			In a smart interior the money you have invested work discreetly.
			Fashions come and go. We do not create fashionable but topical interiors.</p>
			<p>Topical interiors are diverse.</p>
			<p>LLC "SK KROST" does not only come to solve the objectives that are set.
			Sometimes it is more difficult to formulate the objective than to solve it. We know how to do both.
			LLC "SK KROST" works for offbeat decisions.</p>
			<p>We think out-of-the-box.</p>
			<p>Space has hidden potential. We use it to create our projects very special.
			LLC "SK KROST" is pleased to welcome you among our clients!</p>
